# Issues and To-dos#

## Instructions are too fast. ##
You can add pauses with SSML text. See https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference. Flask-Ask doesn't seem to interpret text as SSML, though.

## use cards for photos ##
Alexa app doesn't load images.

## reprompt if alexa doesn't understand ##

## save session so user can pick up on next exercise ##

## deploy and beta test ##
